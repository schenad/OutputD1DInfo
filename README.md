# OutputD1DInfo
[![release](https://github.com/schenad/OutputD1DInfo/blob/master/Release/badge.svg)](https://github.com/schenad/OutputD1DInfo/releases)

Read in all the .D1D files (SPA-LEED 1-D scans) in the same folder and output all the headers to an Excel file.

## Usage

Simply put the .exe in the same folder and it will output an Excel file that contains all the information. In the folder, sample *.D1D files are provided for testing. 

In a rare case, the program cannot read the last digit of the year when the data was taken, and you need to input it by hand.
